- company: Firefly Aerospace
  position: Materials and Process Engineer
  duration: June 2022 &mdash; June 2024
  summary: I led materials and processes engineering for Firefly's rocket engine product lines which essentially meant translating drawings into "something that would hurt your toe if you dropped it." This involved writing material specifications, supplier development, failure analyses, material studies, and process development across a wide range of materials.

- company: Center for Design and Manufacturing Excellence
  position: Graduate Research Associate
  duration: Febrauary 2021 &mdash; May 2022
  summary: At the CDME, I had a variety of responsibilities ranging from operating our laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) additive manufacturing (AM) machines (including design, machine preparation, operation, unpacking, and post processing activities such as powder removal, wire-EDM, and media blasting), to performing L-PBF AM research (such as real-time in-situ monitoring, parameter development for new materials, etc.), and managing the day-to-day operations of the CDME's metal AM facility (which includes machines from eight different OEM's, a wire-EDM, and support equipment (vacuums, sieves, etc.)).

- company: Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering
  position: Graduate Teaching Associate
  duration: August 2020 &mdash; May 2022
  summary: I was responsible for aiding students in the design and execution of experiments for their senior design capstone course &mdash; a project-based research experience. As part of my duties, I helped the students select an appropriate instrumentation setup and teach the basics of data analysis and best practices for performing experiments.

- company: Battelle Center for Science, Engineering, and Public Policy
  position: Research Associate
  duration: November 2018 &mdash; May 2022
  summary: In this role, I performed strategic policy analyses and stakeholder landscape investigations on challenges facing America's hypersonic workforce development, through a federal grant awarded to the Center by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division. The sponsoring organization adopted several of our policy recommendations. Previously, I formed and led a team in the design of a novel pressurization system for spacecraft and launch vehicles. I presented and published this work at the International Astronautical Congress, and at the AIAA Region III Student Conference. This work has now transitioned into a capstone project for the senior aerospace research design course.

- company: Firefly Aerospace
  position: Propulsion Research
  duration: May 2020 &mdash; August 2020
  summary: In this role, I led the initial design of the next generation second stage engine for the Firefly Alpha launch vehicle. This kerolox, tap-off cycle engine utilizes generative design principles and advanced manufacturing techniques to achieve pump-fed performance with the simplicity of a pressure-fed cycle. My responsibilities included defining and managing the system's functional requirements, establishing innovative manufacturing methods, and performing analysis related to the combustion performance of the proprietary injector design.

- company: Firefly Aerospace
  position: Propulsion Engineering Intern
  duration: May 2019 &mdash; August 2019
  summary: During this internship, I served as the responsible engineer for the Firefly Alpha rocket's first stage engine fluid systems. I performed a range of tasks including the design of propulsion components, development of work instructions, assembly of the engine, and created, performed, and analyzed test plans for fluid components.

- company: Turbine Aerothermodynamics Lab
  position: Undergraduate Research Associate
  duration: August 2019 &mdash; April 2020
  summary: As a research assistant, I used particle shadow velocimetry to characterize the evolution of dust deposits in conditions similar to the internal cooling passages of a gas turbine engine. I also developed MATLAB code to quickly process, analyze, and interpret results from experiments performed at the lab's Coefficient of Restitution facility.

- company: Cleveland Electric Laboratories
  position: Design Engineer
  duration: September 2018 &mdash; May 2019
  summary: In this role, I designed and analyzed two production bake ovens/furnaces which required collaboration and interface with multiple departments. I was also responsible for managing CAD documents and drawings for the company.

- company: Firefly Aerospace
  position: Design Engineering Intern
  duration: May 2018  &mdash; August 2018
  summary: During my first internship with Firefly, I was a member of the design and analysis team and was able to contribute to tasks ranging from the design of composite structures to the assembly and integration of Firefly's first ever second stage development vehicle, thanks in part to the small size of the company at the time (fewer than one hundred employees).

- company: Buckeye Space Launch Initiative
  position: Propulsion and Structures Group
  duration: August 2017 &mdash; May 2018
  summary: I worked on the 2017 BSLI 30,000 ft competition rocket where I modeled components, performed carbon fiber and fiberglass lay-ups, and designed a custom integration tool for installing bulk heads.

- company: Cleveland Electric Laboratories
  position: Engineering Intern
  duration: May 2017 &mdash; May 2018
  summary: I was responsible for drafting all customer drawings and created and implemented formal drafting conventions and guidelines. In addition, I worked in the certification and calibration laboratory.

- company: Discovery Lab, Air Force Research Laboratory
  position: Research Intern
  duration: May 2015 &mdash; August 2015
  summary: I served as a member of Cyber Team 6, under Dr. Rob Williams, and researched network penetration techniques.
